# Design Patterns

Quote from Christopher Alexander:

"Eeach pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."

In general a Pattern has four essential elements:

1. The **pattern name** is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences in a word or two.
2. The **problem** describes when to apply the pattern.
3. The **solution** describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
4. The **consequences** are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.
